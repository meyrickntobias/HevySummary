Things I'd like to do to improve this:
 - Need to store the API key something more secure
 - Logging
 - Move most of the logic out of the controller
 - Add a reference date so you can go back in the past
 - Add persistent storage so you can save data and not have to make requests to the API all the time
 - Create a frontend to visualize the data
 - Create a more detailed endpoint which gives you more information about the workouts that contribute to all of the sets
 
 - Create dockerfile for Redis cache
 - Create dockerfile for the API
 - Create build script for building the whole thing
