# HevySummary
An ASP.NET Core Web API that summarizes data from the fitness app Hevy, using the public Hevy API. 
To use this on your own data, find your Hevy API key (can be found in the settings of the app). Once you've cloned the project, copy the `.env.sample` file and update the `HevyApiKey` variable. Now you can run the app and send requests to it. The only endpoint currently returns sets per muscle group per week.
